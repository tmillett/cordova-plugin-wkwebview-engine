Cordova WKWebView Engine
======

This plugin makes `Cordova` use the `WKWebView` component instead of the default `UIWebView` component, and is installable only on a system with the iOS 9.0 SDK. 

In iOS 9, Apple has fixed the [issue](http://www.openradar.me/18039024) present through iOS 8 where you cannot load locale files using file://, and must resort to using a local webserver. **However, you are still not able to use XHR from the file:// protocol without [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) enabled on your server.**

Notes
------

On an iOS 8 system, Apache Cordova during runtime will switch to using the UIWebView engine instead of using this plugin. If you want to use WKWebView on both iOS 8 and iOS 9 platforms, you will have to resort to using a local webserver.

Limitations
--------

If you are upgrading from UIWebView, please note the limitations of using WKWebView as outlined in our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CB%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20wkwebview-known-issues).

Apple Issues
-------

The `AllowInlineMediaPlayback` preference will not work because of this [Apple bug](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6673091526656000).
